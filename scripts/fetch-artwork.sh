# The lock holds the commit once and a sha256 for every file Utah takes, so a
# path that is not listed fails rather than being fetched unchecked, and moving
# the commit without moving the checksums fails the same way. raw.githubusercontent.com
# serves a commit-addressed path immutably, which a tag or branch would not.
#
# Used by the `artwork` stage of the Containerfile and by the ISO builders
# (iso/scripts/build-iso*.sh), which stage the installer art into the live
# overlay's build context. UTAH_ARTWORK_LOCK overrides the lock path and
# UTAH_ARTWORK_BASE the URL prefix (tests point it at a file:// tree).
